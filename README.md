# Color Refinement

Based on [Grohe et al. "Dimension Reduction via Color Refinement"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.5697.pdf). The following plots show the Original Graph as a Matrix (color means there exists an edge for the given pair),
and on the right is the permutated Matrix according to the partitions calculated by Color Refinement (also known as 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman):

Color Refinement finds the coarsest stable coloring. The plots show that some kind of symmetry information.
